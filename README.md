# Landing-page
This is a project from The Odin Project to create an entire web page from a design provided.
I will be using HTML and CSS to complete this task while also making sure to commit my code when I reeach certain steps.
This is so that I get into the habit of committing my code in order to be able to go back incase I mess up my code.
